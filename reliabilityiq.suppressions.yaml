# ReliabilityIQ central suppressions
# Format:
# - path: <glob>
#   rule: <rule-id>
#   fingerprint: <optional>
#
# Notes:
# - `path` and `rule` are required.
# - `fingerprint` is optional and narrows suppression to a specific finding instance.
# - Keep this file minimal; prefer fixing code over broad suppressions.

# Example: suppress one noisy DNS rule in test fixtures
- path: tests/fixtures/**
  rule: portability.hardcoded.dns

# Example: suppress localhost findings in local dev bootstrap scripts
- path: scripts/dev/**
  rule: portability.hardcoded.localhost
